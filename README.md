# Experimental Rust Game Engine



# Important Links used in creation of engine

# Crates

* https://crates.io/crates/vulkanalia - Raw bindings to the Vulkan API
* https://crates.io/crates/rand - Random number generation library


# Goal of Project

The goal of this project is to learn how to make a game engine in rust with the Vulkan Graphics API.

The learning process will be documented below to help anyone trying out the same thing or something similar have access to the proper materials to learn.


# Learning Process

1. Learn rust first (Good video to learn is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygL_xcavzQ4&t=2s&ab_channel=DerekBanas))
